# ExpressLister Privacy Policy

## Data Collection

ExpressLister only uses information locally on the browser to complete its function. Data is not collected and sent to third parties, nor is it used beyond the limited functionality of the extension.

That being said, there are a few other ways your data is used that is outside of the extension's control.

## Chrome Storage API

ExpressLister uses [Google Chrome's Storage API](https://developers.chrome.com/extensions/storage) to locally store minimal information to pre-populate the draft listing form. This is similar to a [cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies). Google syncs this information across your various computers and Chrome installations. However, my extensions only access this data locally on your machine and they do not transmit it.

## Chrome Tabs API

ExpressLister uses [Google Chrome's Tabs API](https://developers.chrome.com/extensions/tabs) to read the product ID from the URL to gather additional details about the product. ExpressLister only accesses the url's as posted in the Host Permissions of the extension.

## Chrome Scripting API

ExpressLister uses [Google Chrome's Scripting API](https://developers.chrome.com/extensions/scripting) to injected html, css, and js into webpages to provide the user with a way to navigate the extension's functionality.

## Third-Party APIs

ExpressLister accesses third party APIs and reports back the results. For example, the data is sent to the eBay API in order to populate the information in the draft. Generally, when these third Party API services, they will send some non-personal information about the page you are visiting. However, when extensions access a third party API, there is some personal information that third party receives in the [request header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Request_header), most notably your [IP address](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/basics/what-is-an-ip-address.htm) and [user agent string](https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/user-agent). Some companies will use information like that to develop a â€œ[browser fingerprint](https://pixelprivacy.com/resources/browser-fingerprinting/)" that can probably track and personally identify you. Unfortunately, this is not something that ExpressLister has control over. If this is a concern for you, consider using a VPN to mask your IP address.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

If there are substantive<sup>1</sup> changes made to this blanket privacy policy or to the individual privacy policies of any of my extensions, I will push out a new version of the affected extension(s) and ask you to agree to the amended privacy policy.

## Feedback

If you have questions or concerns about this privacy policy, feel free to [send me an email](mailto:p1collectibles@outlook.com).

#### Notes:
1 - When I say "substantive," I mean that I won't push out app updates for minor changes like fixing a typo.
